* DNA keyboard with 4 keys A, C, T, and G.

** Steps to create
 1. 3d print case.
 2. Add and solder pro micro to 4 mechanical switches.
 3. Add [[https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware][qmk_keyboard]] software to the pro micro.
 4. Start typing.

** Features
*** Ambiguous nucleotides 
 - A = adenine
 - C = cytosine
 - G = guanine
 - T = thymine
 - R = G A (purine)
 - Y = T C (pyrimidine)
 - K = G T (keto)
 - M = A C (amino)
 - S = G C (strong bonds)
 - W = A T (weak bonds)
 - B = G T C (all but A)
 - D = G A T (all but C)
 - H = A C T (all but G)
 - V = G C A (all but T)
 - N = A G C T (any)
*** Amino acid typing
To switch to this mode type out DNA from nucleotides typing mode.

| Amino acid | Codons                       |
| Ala / A    | GCU, GCC, GCA, GCG           |
| Arg / R    | CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, AGG |
| Asn / N    | AAU, AAC                     |
| Asp / D    | GAU, GAC                     |
| Cys / C    | UGU, UGC                     |
| Gln / Q    | CAA, CAG                     |
| Glu / E    | GAA, GAG                     |
| Gly / G    | GGU, GGC, GGA, GGG           |
| His / H    | CAU, CAC                     |
| Ile / I    | AUU, AUC, AUA                |
| Leu / L    | UUA, UUG, CUU, CUC, CUA, CUG |
| Lys / K    | AAA, AAG                     |
| Met / M    | AUG                          |
| Phe / F    | UUU, UUC                     |
| Pro / P    | CCU, CCC, CCA, CCG           |
| Ser / S    | UCU, UCC, UCA, UCG, AGU, AGC |
| Thr / T    | ACU, ACC, ACA, ACG           |
| Trp / W    | UGG                          |
| Tyr / Y    | UAU, UAC                     |
| Val / V    | GUU, GUC, GUA, GUG           |
| START      | AUG                          |
| STOP       | UAA, UGA, UAG                |

*** Binary ASCII typing
To switch to this mode type ASCII from Amino acid typing mode.
 - ASCII is 8 bits typing letters and control codes.
 - A sends a 1, T sends a 0, C/G quits back to amino acid typing mode.
 - Most significant bit is typed first.
 - So to type a newline (0x0A = 0b00001010) press TTTTATAT.

*** Tetris
To switch to this mode type TETRIS from Amino acid typing mode.

** Nice 3d printed keycaps
To get some nice keycaps I printed out A, C, T, G (75% scaled) of the
models from [[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:714312][Folding DNA model kit by mkuiper]].

I then printed 4 keycap mounts ([[https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:344133][Cherry MX keycap mount by gcb]]) and
glued the nucleotides to them.
